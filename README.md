eqCheck

EQ Check is a tool that calls GROMACS to perform a set of calculations to check the output of a membrane/protein equilibration. User must have GROMACS installed and 
on their path. If -C option is used, eqCheck will detect the file names for a CHARMM-GUI equilibration and automatically concatenate the NVT and NPT files. Use
